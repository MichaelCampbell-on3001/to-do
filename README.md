## Server Swap

### Authentication Server Phase 2: Token (Bearer) Authentication

### Author: Michael Campbell

#### Description: 
- This project is an exercise to see if I can swap out a working server for another working server and what it takes to get there.
- The code base for the server was provided by Micha and Jacob from the inclass demo.
-The code base for the front-end is from the 301 final assessment.
The goal is to seperate the 301 assement from its current server and wire it to our auth-api-server found in our class repo.
